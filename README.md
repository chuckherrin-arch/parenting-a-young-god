An answer to Dario Amodei's recent article referencing how we survive our technological adolescence. In this article, veteran CISO and risk manager performs a key failure analysis and offers a perspective on two key biological constraints that he posits must be understood, as well as an invitation for collaboration to pressure test the thesis. 

TL;DR - our brains process signals through a primitive 'rules engine' that moves faster than the circuitry to our most advanced cognitive functions. Our brains can also only maintain about 150 'real relationships'. Both are evolutionary constraints, and my thesis is these two constraints combine into a documented cycle of division and violence. 

These same brains are the ones we modeled AI on, and all data sent to AI for Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback (RLHF) goes through these human filters as well. 

If you are seeing this page, I'm probably making updates as I continue to gather supporting and opposing sources. Back soon. Thanks!
