An answer to Dario Amodei's recent article referencing how we survive our technological adolescence. In this article, Chuck Herrin, veteran CISO and risk manager performs a key failure analysis and offers a perspective on two key biological constraints that he posits must be understood, as well as an invitation for collaboration to pressure test the thesis. We can't address problems we don't know about, and we all have blind spots. 

TL;DR - our brains process fear signals through a primitive 'rules engine' that moves faster than the circuitry to our most advanced cognitive functions. Our brains can also only maintain about 150-500 'real relationships'. Both are evolutionary constraints, and my thesis is these two constraints combine into a documented cycle of division and violence. This is zero-sum thinking driving zero-sum / win lose behavior in a closed loop system. 

These same brains are the ones we modeled AI on, and data sent to AI for Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback (RLHF) goes through these human filters as well. 

Like with any engineering challenge, building the world of tomorrow means understanding the constraints of today. Anyone versed in Kaizen or LEAN can tell you all about the importance of identifying the right problems. 

If you are seeing this page, I'm down for updates. It's just me working on this right now, and I'm making some mistakes while I learn how to use AI like NotebookLM to synthesize this information for you, but I'll knock out some changes today and be back soon. Thanks!
